\begin{abstract}
We study how strategic commitment can enhance social welfare in a conflict game of incomplete information. We design gender balanced sessions to study whether gender differences affect convergence to the optimal solution. In the baseline treatment, players simultaneously commit to either a Hawkish or Dovish action, where the latter can enhance social welfare. We add a sequential and an endogenous move treatment, where in the former, the first mover is exogenously selected and in the latter, players self-select the order of play. We argue that in our simultaneous and sequential games, men and women may make similar decisions, but for different reasons. Our exogenous games offer a test of this
hypothesis. Our results suggest that (i) social welfare is higher in the last two treatments, (ii) men and women make similar decisions in the simultaneous and
sequential games, and (iii) women prefer to guarantee a minimum payoff by playing Hawk when the order of play is endogenously determined.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In uncertain times, cooperation is often necessary to avoid socially inefficient outcomes. Unfortunately, recently empty shelves in supermarkets due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, and the occurrence of bank runs throughout history, suggest that the required level of cooperation is not always easy to achieve. Even though the agents in both aforementioned cases would be better off by choosing a cooperative action, the fear that a counterparty will not cooperate can trigger the decision to hoard or withdraw, thus creating a run. A voluntary precommitment to a cooperative action can enhance welfare in certain strategic environments in which agents have strong incentives to follow the actions of others. 

To study the role of precommitment in a conflict game of strategic complements we extend the theoretical framework of Baliga and Sj\"ostr\"om (2004, hereafter BS04, 2009) and conduct a laboratory experiment to test three different environments, which are characterized by the extent of incomplete information: (i) simultaneous (CGO), first proposed by BS04, (ii) sequential (CGS), in which the order of play is exogenously imposed, and (iii) endogenous (CGE), in which players self-select the order of play. In the latter environment, when both players select to move first (second) the game becomes simultaneous and equivalent to CGO. When the players select a different order of play, then the game becomes sequential and equivalent to CGS. Thus, the CGE treatment can resemble both the simultaneous and the sequential treatments, depending on the self-selected order of play. The CGE treatment exhibits higher levels of strategic uncertainty relative to both CGS and CGO treatments, since in CGE players do not know (i) the action of counterparty, nor (ii) the timing of play (sequential or simultaneous). 

In the CGO game, BS04 propose a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) which suggests that player types at or below a unique cutoff strategy will play $D$ ($D$ for Dove) while others play $H$ ($H$ for Hawk).\footnote{In contrast to most global games literature (Carlsson and Van Damme, 1993; Morris and Shin, 2005), Farrell and Saloner (1985) and BS04 assume that types are not correlated and receive no signals about counterparty payoff. } Even if players are not intrinsically hawkish, they may end up choosing $H$ because they are unable to rule out the possibility that the opponent is a dominant hawk type, or in the case of second order beliefs, that the opponent believes that his opponent will play $H$. In our experiment, we elicit cutoff strategies in the CGO as well as in the other treatments using a slider, which results in a rich distribution of choices across treatments. Following previous lab experiments that also study BS04, we find that players play $D$ more often than predicted by BNE. 

Theoretically, the cutoff strategy should increase the frequency of the socially optimal outcome ($DD$) in the CGS game. In this treatment, we elicit the cutoff for all pairs as in CGO, but the mutual fear of $H$ strategy by an opponent is reduced due to the fact that the cutoff for the second mover is not binding. The experimental results confirm the direction of the predictions. Players adjust their cutoffs to play $D$ more often in the CGS treatment relative to the CGO treatment, but not to the extent predicted by theory under the assumption of risk neutrality.

In the CGE treatment, theory suggests that in addition to the pooling equilibrium that resembles the CGO environment, there is also a separating equilibrium in which players self-sort such that the dovish types move first, and the hawkish types move second. Thus, the likelihood of $DD$ is at least as high as in the CGE treatment as in the CGO treatment. The experimental results suggest that gender plays a role in how the CGE game is viewed by players as a CGO or a CGS. Our analysis shows that women select a cutoff similar to the one observed in the CGO game while men select a cutoff similar to the one observed in the CGS game, where frequency of moving first increases when they commit to $D$. Therefore, the results of our study suggest that women prefer to have more control of the payoff distribution relative to men by imposing a definitive lower bound on earnings. Such behavior is also consistent with risk minimization.

We do not find any statistical difference in the distribution of cutoffs across gender within the CGO and CGS treatments. Thus, we can conclude that gender characteristics do not matter for achieving the social optimum in the CGO and CGS environments. The lack of gender effect is consistent with the results observed in simultaneous Stag Hunt and Prisoner's Dilemma games. However, this does not imply that the motivations of men and women are the same, nor that they are inconsequential for all classes of games. According to Simpson (2003) and Kuwabara (2005), a simultaneous move game may obscure the true motivations of each gender. In this regard, varying the timing of play can help us assess the importance of underlying motivations in achieving Pareto superior outcomes. 
   

\section{Related literature}

The present paper is related to the studies of Khan (2017) and Evdokimov and Garfagnini (2018), who also test the predictions of the CGO game first proposed by BS04, and observe higher frequencies of $DD$ play than predicted by NE. These studies do not use a cutoff strategy, which appeared in Duffy and Ochs (2012) and most recently in Van Huyck et al. (2018). The latter authors survey participants about how they play the game and find that 72\% report using a threshold. Similar to the behavior observed in our experiment, Duffy and Ochs (2012) also find that there is a significant variation in cutoff strategies across subjects. 

Strategic uncertainty, which exists in our CGE environment, can act as a barrier to superior outcomes and is common in coordination games (see Van Huyck, et al., 1990). CGS helps resolve this uncertainty, as shown by Weber et al. (2004) who find that it is sufficient for the subjects to know that a game is sequential in order to improve welfare. Our work is also related to previous experiments which study cutoff strategies in games of incomplete information with strategic complements.\footnote{For a theoretical description of precommitment in games of complete information with strategic complements and/or substitutes, please refer to Eaton (2004).} Brindisi et al. (2014) find that, in an investment game with correlated player types (a joint investment opportunity), endogenous timing improves social welfare. The results indicate that while coordination is higher under endogenous timing, it is still lower than predicted. In the simultaneous-move game, subjects use a cutoff strategy which deviates from theory, and approaches payoff dominance (similar to what we observe in our CGO treatment). Other games of incomplete information (Van Huyck et al., 2018) and complete information (Heinemann et al., 2004 and Duffy and Ochs, 2012) also report similar findings. However, for some classes of simultaneous-move with games of incomplete information, risk dominance becomes an important factor in strategy selection (Cabrales et al., 2007).

According to the experimental results of Heggedal et al. (2018), risk aversion can deter a first mover from committing to an irreversible action. Their study tests the main predictions of Farrell and Saloner (1985), which is closely related to the environment of BS04. In stage one, players simultaneously decide whether to: (i) remain at status quo (known payoffs) or (ii) choose an alternative (risky payoff) which is irreversible. In stage two, only those players who have not yet committed to an action choose between the two alternatives. If no player committed to an action in stage one, then second stage decisions become simultaneous. The results show that, when the risk of failure is low, players are willing to commit and that they follow the equilibrium cutoff strategy. When the risk of failure is high (i.e., a large payoff loss if the other does not follow through) players are less willing to commit and the behavior deviates from the theoretical prediction. These findings are similar to what we observe in our CGS treatment and partially, in our CGE treatment.

Lack of cooperation has also been observed in situations in which women appear to be more averse to the ``sucker" effect, which occurs when individuals free-ride because they believe that others will as well (see Ingram and Berger, 1977; and Van den Assem et al., 2012). A recent lab-in-the-field experiment in rural India by Gangadharan et al. (2019) finds that women leaders contribute less than they propose in a public goods game, possibly supporting the notion that women fear being the ``sucker." However, according to Babcock et al. (2017) women can overcome the ``sucker" effect in a dynamic volunteer game with strategic substitutes, where women are willing to volunteer more often than men, although it may be costly. Their findings suggest that when there is less payoff uncertainty, women may volunteer more and thus improve social welfare. However, in our game of strategic complements, resolving the payoff uncertainty by choosing $H$ does not lead to Pareto superior outcomes and in fact makes the CGE game resemble CGO. The preference for safe payoffs by women compared to men is also well documented in Crosetto and Filippin (2017).


\section{The environment}
\label{sec:model}
We model our environment after the simultaneous move two-player conflict game of BS04. In this game of incomplete information, player $i$ can pursue either a hawkish (aggressive) action ($H$), or a dovish (peaceful) action ($D$). The action space for a player can be specified as $s\in\{H,D\}$, and leads to the following payoff matrix
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_i & \mu+x_i \\
k-d & k 
\label{t:payoff}
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
%where $k=100$, $\mu=10$ and $d=95$.
where $d<k$, and $\mu<d$ ($\mu > d$) when the game has strategic complements (substitutes). When both players play $H$, each player receives $x_i$, which is an idiosyncratic private payoff that is independently drawn from a uniform distribution $F\in [0,k]$. Therefore, the idiosyncratic $x_i$ can be thought of as hawk type, in which some players are revealed to be more hawkish and thus reap more benefit from action $H$, and some are revealed to be less hawkish and see a lower return to playing $H$. If both players choose the peaceful action $D$, then the payoff to each player is a constant $k$. If player $i$ plays $D$, while player $j\neq i$ plays $H$, then the payoff to player $i$ is $k-d>0$, where $d$ can be considered a cost of a peaceful action when the opponent is aggressive. On the other hand, if player $i$ plays $H$ and player $j\neq i$ plays $D$, then the payoff to player $i$ is $\mu+x_i$, where $\mu>0$ can be viewed as a marginal benefit of an aggressive action when the opponent is peaceful. BS04 present two types of games, one that is characterized with strategic complements, and the other by strategic substitutes.  In a game with strategic complements players are complementary types unless they have a dominant strategy (Dove or Hawk), whereas in a game with strategic substitutes players are opportunistic unless they have a dominant strategy. Figure \ref{fig:typespace} depicts the player type space.

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[ht]

\includegraphics[scale=0.21]{typespace.jpg}%
\caption{Player type ($x_i$) space according to equation (\ref{t:payoff}) under strategic complements (top) and substitutes (bottom). $\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}$ is the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium in the simultaneous game CGO.} 
\label{fig:typespace}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

The Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) can be characterized as a cutoff strategy such that a player with a payout lower than $x_i\leq\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}$ will play $D$, and $H$ otherwise.  When a player is indifferent between $H$ and $D$, we can find the cutoff as the unique fixed point where 
\begin{equation}
\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}:= k-d + (d-\mu) F(\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}). \label{eq:cgo}
\end{equation}

\newtheorem{lem}{Lemma}
\begin{lem}
In the unique Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE), the probability that player $i$ plays $D$ is $F(\hat{x}_{_{CGO}})$, where $\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}$ is the unique fixed point of the player's best response as specified by equation (\ref{eq:cgo}).
\end{lem}\par

From Figure \ref{fig:typespace}, we can see that even when player $i$ is a nondominant strategy hawk, the player may play $H$ due to fear of encountering dominant strategy hawks. This leads to a spiral of fear, or what Baliga and Sj\"ostr\"om (2012) call the ``Hobbesian trap,''  in which a unique cutoff defines player's strategy. Given that $F(\cdot)$ follows a uniform distribution in the space $[0,k]$, and using the parameters of our experiment $\{k=100, \mu=10, d=95 \}$, the cutoff point can be rewritten as 
\begin{equation}
\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}:= \frac{k\cdot (k-d)}{k-d+\mu}=33. \label{eq:cgosol}
\end{equation}


In this paper, we examine whether players can escape the Hobbesian trap by using strategic precommitment and varying the timing of play. A possible mechanism for improving welfare in a simultaneous move game (CGO) with strategic complements is for players to move sequentially, in either an exogenous sequential move game (CGS) and/or an endogenous move game (CGE). In the former, the order of play is randomly determined while in the latter players self-select the order of play. Social welfare under a CGS game is significantly higher relative to the CGO game. However, in a CGE game social welfare can be similar to either the CGO or a CGS environment, depending on the order of play selected by players. We begin by describing the optimal strategy in a CGS game, in which a player is randomly selected to move first after selecting their cutoff strategy. 

The cutoff strategy for the first mover in a CGS game shifts to the right of the optimal strategy in a CGO game, such that $\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}\leq\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}$ when the game has strategic complements. That is, in order to play $H$ in a CGS environment, a player has to be more hawkish, or requires a higher payoff to $H$. The intuition for the rightward shift in the cutoff strategy is fairly straightforward. Consider a first mover at the original cutoff $\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}$ in Figure \ref{fig:typespace}. If the first mover selects $D$, then he/she will obtain a higher expected profit because the probability that the second mover will play $D$ as well is greater given that types with $x_i<k-\mu$ best respond by playing $D$. Only the hawk dominant types will play $H$ (under a uniform distribution, this occurs with a probability of $\mu=.1$ in our game). In other words, the probability that the other player plays $D$ increases from $Pr(x_j\leq\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}) \equiv F(\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}$) in the CGO game to  $Pr(x_j\leq k-\mu) \equiv F(k-\mu)  $ in the CGS game. 

\begin{lem}
There exists a unique perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE) in which the first mover uses the cutoff strategy, $\sigma_i(x_i)=D$ if $x_i\leq \hat{x}_{_{CGS}} \equiv k-d\cdot(1-F(k-\mu))-\mu\cdot F(k-d)$.  In the PBNE, $\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}<\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}$ when the game has strategic complements and $\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}>\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}$ when the game has strategic substitutes.
\end{lem}\par
\noindent \textit{Proof:} See Appendix A $\blacksquare$

Using the parameters of our experiment, the unique PBNE in which the first mover uses the cutoff strategy can be defined as
\begin{equation}
\sigma_i(x_i)=D \quad \text{if} \ \ x_i\leq \hat{x}_{_{CGS}}:= k-\mu=90. 
\end{equation}

Next, we examine the CGE game in which players self-select the order of play. In this environment, after selecting their respective cutoffs, players simultaneously decide whether to move early or late. When a player decides to move early, he/she commits to the action chosen during the cutoff stage. A player who chooses to move late is not constrained by the action specified in the cutoff stage.\footnote{Hamilton and Slutsky (1990) introduce this rule of endogenous timing in the form of the extended game with action commitment in a duopoly game under complete information.} Formally, the timing of the game proceeds as follows:

\textit{Stage 0:} Each player $i$ selects a cutoff strategy, indicating a set of values where $\sigma_i(x_i)=H$, and then observes own type $x_i$, but not the other player's type $x_j$ where $j\neq i$.

 \textit{Stage 1:} Both players simultaneously select the period in which to play the game $t=1,2$. 

\textit{Stage 2:} The conflict game is played by the move structure determined in Stage 1. The commitment to the cutoff strategy is not binding for player $i$ if and only if $t_i=2$ and $t_j=1$. 

The prediction for the player cutoff strategy in the CGE game with strategic complements follows either the CGO or CGS predictions. First, there exists a pooling equilibrium in which every type $x_i \in [0,k]$ is selecting the same period of play. In such case the game resembles the simultaneous environment discussed in the CGO game (Lemma 1). Moreover, there also exists a separating equilibrium, where a subset of types commits to an early dovish action ($t_{i}(x_i)=1; D$), while other types wait ($t_{i}(x_i)=2$). This separating equilibrium is consistent with Lemma 2. The results are summarized in Proposition 1.

\newtheorem{prop}{Proposition}
\begin{prop}
In the endogenous move conflict game there exists a pooling equilibrium  when the game is characterized by either strategic substitutes or complements. When the game is characterized solely by strategic complements, there exists a unique separating equilibrium, such that the players' strategies are defined as: $t_{i}(x_i)=1; D$ for $x_i\leq \hat{x}_{_{CGS}}$, and $t_{i}(x_i)=2$ for $x_i>\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}$. 

\end{prop}\par
\noindent \textit{Proof:} See Appendix A $\blacksquare$

In the CGE game with strategic complements, a player only wants to move early if he/she plans to choose $D$. Thus, dovish players move early and commit to $D$. Dominant strategy hawks, in Figure \ref{fig:typespace}, wait and choose $H$ as late as possible.\footnote{Under a general distribution of $F(\cdot)$, there are in-between types, $x_i \in [ \hat{x}_{_{CGS}}, k-\mu)$ who exhibit a wait-and-see attitude. They are unwilling to commit early, but if an opponent commits to $D$, then they will reciprocate.}

\section{Hypotheses}


\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 1}
\textit{In the simultaneous conflict game (CGO) subjects play at or above the cutoff strategy $\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}=33$.}\\

We reconcile the theoretical solution of the CGO game with experimental evidence for our first prediction. In the laboratory, subjects play $D$ more often than predicted by the Nash Equilibrium (NE). \\

\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 2}
\textit{The cutoff strategy in the sequential CGS game is higher compared to the cutoff strategy in the simultaneous move CGO game.}\\

Note that the equilibrium predictions $\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}=90$ and $\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}=33$ are far apart. This allows us to observe meaningful differences even when players chose cutoff values greater than the NE described in Prediction 1. The gain in expected payoff is equal to $d\times \left( F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGO}}) \right)=95\times( 90-33)/100=50$ points or 137\%. \\

\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 3A} \textit{In the CGE environment, a player will behave as in the CGO game. }\\
\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 3B} \textit{In the CGE environment, a player will behave as in the CGS game.}\\

The CGE environment can lead to multiple equilibria. We are uncertain about the type of equilibrium that will prevail in our experiment. The two conflicting Predictions 3A and 3B reflect the pooling equilibrium and the separating equilibrium, respectively. Our experiment is designed to test which type of equilibrium, if any, will prevail. \\

\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 4}
\textit{The frequency of a $DD$ outcome in the CGS game is greater than the frequency of a $DD$ outcome in the CGO game. In the CGE game, the frequency of $DD$ is no smaller than in the CGO game}.\\

The coordination required to achieve the $DD$ outcome should be easier to achieve in a sequential game. Therefore, the frequency of $DD$ should be higher in the CGS game relative to the CGO game. The CGE game can lead to either the CGS game or CGO game following our previous Hypothesis 3A and 3B. Thus, no matter what type of equilibrium prevails in the CGE, we expect that the frequency of $DD$ will be no lower than in the CGO.\\


\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 5}
\textit{There is no gender difference in strategy choices across the three treatments.}\\

Previous literature on cooperative behavior in games such as Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) and Stag Hunt has found no observable gender differences across strategies. According to Simpson (2003) and Kuwabara (2005), the lack of evidence does not necessarily mean that both genders have same motivations but rather that in some simultaneous move games, different motivations can lead to the same choices, and a subsequent conclusion of no gender difference. In particular, Simpson (2003) and Kuwabara (2005) argue that in a PD game, men defect due to greed and free-riding, while women are motivated by fear and defect to avoid exploitation. In our CGO treatment, when both players move simultaneously, the fear/greed argument would suggest that men will play $H$ to exploit cooperative partners and women will play $H$ to avoid being exploited by greedy partners. Therefore, in the CGO game, we should not observe any gender differences as both genders will play $H$ more often though underlying motivations may be different.

The CGS game reduces but does not eliminate the fear of exploitation as there is always a chance that the counterparty is a dominant hawkish type. Therefore, women will adjust their cutoffs in the direction of the NE prediction. For men, exploitation is harder to achieve under the current parameterization unless they are dominant hawkish types. Hence, men also adjust their cutoffs in the direction of the NE prediction. Finally, in the CGE game, there is an uncertainty about whether the encounter will be simultaneous or sequential in nature. Fear and greed can trigger a cutoff similar to the one predicted in the CGO game, which is reinforced by the lack of ability to coordinate. However, payoff dominance can lead to cutoff choices which resemble the predictions of the CGS game and which we expect to be similar across genders.  

Some bank run experiments show mixed evidence on the role of gender. Kiss et al. (2014) do not find significant differences on withdrawing rates across gender, while Dijk (2017) reports that women are more likely to withdraw as fear increases. In sum, given the mixed evidence, we do not take any strong position regarding the role of gender in the observed action of play in all of our treatments.


\section{Laboratory procedures}
\label{sec:game}

The experiment was conducted at the Rosario Experimental and Behavioral Economics Lab (REBEL) of the Universidad del Rosario, Colombia. Participants were undergraduate students from all fields and were recruited online via ORSEE (Greiner, 2015). Subjects were part of one of the three treatments (between design) ---CGO, CGS and CGE---  with  a session consisting of five practice periods and 11 paid periods. We paid subjects for all periods.\footnote{For the documentation in Spanish, the language used for the sessions in Colombia, please contact the corresponding author.} Overall, we conducted nine sessions, with two silos per session. In each session there were two roughly gender-balanced silos of 12 subjects, each playing one of the three games. The participants were not informed that the study also focused on analyzing possible gender differences.

In each silo, the game began with five solo practice rounds, in which the counterparty was a robot who played the NE prediction.\footnote{The motivation behind using a robot was to help subjects learn how a threshold strategy works in this environment. The robot used the same strategy in all treatments, to keep the effect of practice constant. There is no evidence that robot strategies affected actual play since players in the CGO game did not converge to the predicted NE (see Result 1). Furthermore, we do not mention in the instructions that the robot is using an optimal or equilibrium strategy.} The subject's task was to pick the minimum number of $x$ in the interval $[0,101]$ for which he/she will play $H$ (labelled $A$ in the experiment). That is, we directly ask the subject to select a cutoff strategy without having the knowledge of own $x$, and that of the counterparty. The user-interface designed in oTree (Chen, et al., 2016) is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ui}. To select a cutoff value, the participant used a mouse to move the slider, and then confirmed her choice by clicking ``Next." For example, a subject who would like to play only $D$ ($H$) should move the slider to the extreme right (left). The user-interface in Figure \ref{fig:ui} presents the updated payoff matrix with the cutoff selection. In the payoff matrix, the unknown value of $x$ for the counterparty is depicted as $NN$.

\centering{}%
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{cutoffen.png}%
\caption{User-Interface cutoff decision} 
\label{fig:ui}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

Following five practice rounds, subjects played 11 paid rounds. Each participant was matched with another participant only once (perfect stranger matching).  In all three treatments, subjects selected their cutoffs simultaneously, and were unaware of the counterparty's gender. The steps following the cutoff selection varied according to treatment. We summarize the variations of the game in Table \ref{table:time}. 

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}

\caption{Timeline for each treatment}
\label{table:time}

\begin{tabular}{l|m{2.8cm}|m{3.5cm}|m{5cm}}
  Step & CGO & CGS & CGE\\
  \hline 
I & Cutoff & Cutoff & Cutoff \\
\hline
II& $x_i$ is revealed; D if $x_i< \text{cutoff}$ & $x_i$ is revealed; D if $x_i< \text{cutoff}$ for 1st mover (randomly chosen)
& $x_i$ is revealed; choose $t=\{1,2\}$ with action commitment defined according to \textit{cutoff}\\
\hline
III & - & 2nd mover picks \textbf{s} & 2nd mover ($t=2$) picks \textbf{s} if other chose $t=1$. Otherwise, the game is simultaneous.\\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

In the CGO game, the value $x_i$ is revealed to player $i$ and if the cutoff selected is smaller than or equal to revealed $x_i$, then the subject will play $H$, and $D$ otherwise. Following the actions, $H$ or $D$, of both players, payoffs are computed according to the payoff matrix in equation (\ref{t:payoff}). In the CGS game, the first mover is randomly selected after all subjects select the cutoff point. This ensures that the cutoff decisions are independent of the imposed order of play, and allows us to have a fairly balanced number of silos across treatments. It is also important to emphasize that the subjects know that the cutoff decisions are binding (relaxed) for first (second) movers. The second mover picks an action $s\in\{H,D\}$ conditional on the first mover's action. That is, the second mover does not face the same payoff matrix as presented to the first mover. Instead, the payoff matrix in the CGS game for the second mover reflects the action selected by the first mover, and is thus reduced to a matrix with dimensions $2 \times 1$. In the CGE game, after $x_i$ is revealed, subjects choose the order of play. If both players select the same period of play, then the game becomes simultaneous. If one player picks the first period while the other player picks the second period, then the game is sequential and the cutoff choice for the second mover is relaxed. The second mover makes a decision knowing the action of the first mover.

At the end of each round, for all treatments, we provide feedback regarding own and counterparty choices, as well as individual payoff information. Following 11 rounds of play, accumulated points over all rounds were converted to COL at the exchange rate of COL 20 per point. Earnings, including a show-up fee of COL 10,000 (\$ 3.3), were paid in cash. On average, players earned 792.8 points (\$ 5.2) for a session that lasted approximately 45 minutes. Table \ref{session} presents the average profit as well as other relevant information per treatment.\footnote{To provide context for our payments, the monthly minimum wage in Colombia was COL 781,281 when we ran the experiment. Assuming 20 workdays a month, and 8 hour workdays, we obtain an hourly rate of COL 4,483. Thus, the show-up fee of COL 10,000 is high enough to attract and incentivize people to participate in the experiment. On average, the participants earned a profit that was 1.5 times the show-up fee for an experiment which lasted less than one hour.} 

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We begin our analysis by taking a nonparametric approach to test our predictions. Figure \ref{fig:allcutoff} presents the CDFs by treatment, where we compute the median cutoff choice by subject in rounds 6 through 11.\footnote{Regression analysis (shown further below) includes all 11 periods with a trend variable to account for learning, and confirms these results.} We also present the NE predictions for CGO and CGS treatments as vertical lines in Figure \ref{fig:allcutoff}. Recall that in the CGE game, equilibrium behavior could be consistent with either the CGO or the CGS game.

\noindent \textbf{Result 1}
\textit{The median cutoff strategy in the CGO game is 50.}
\\

 In the CGO game, we can see that the median value is around 50, and that the distribution is fairly uniform, with some qualifications. About 20\% of subjects pick the highest cutoff, which indicates that they strongly prefer to play $D$. Furthermore, we observe no significant mass centered around 33 as predicted in Hypothesis 1. In fact, the one sample Wilcoxon test using subject data strongly rejects the hypothesis that cutoff strategy in the CGO game is equal to the NE prediction (p-value $< .01$). Table \ref{tab(cutoffs)} presents the main cutoff statistics for all treatments. We observe learning since the median cutoff for CGO is 54 using all periods and moves towards the NE prediction when the sample is restricted to the late periods. \\

\noindent \textbf{Result 2}
\textit{In the CGS game, players increase the median cutoff to 66.}\\

The CDF for the CGS game in Figure \ref{fig:allcutoff} first-order stochastically dominates the CDF for CGO game which confirms our Hypothesis 2 (the p-value of a Wilcoxon test is .036 as shown in Table \ref{tab(cutoff-pvalue)}).\footnote{If we take an extremely conservative approach and work at the group level, then the p-value is .093.} The mass in the CGS game approaches the predicted NE of 90, though it still falls short. The median cutoff strategy is 66, and is different than the NE prediction (p-value $< .001$).  Similar to the CGO environment, some players in the CGS game select either extremely high or extremely low cutoff values. Overall, the majority of players in the CGS game select a higher threshold relative to the CGO game, thus improving social welfare.\footnote{If we include all periods in a Wilcoxon test, we fail to reject that CGO and CGS distributions are equal. The significance (at 5\%) of the results appears from periods 3 to 11. Our sample includes periods 6 to 11 to account for learning.}\\


\noindent \textbf{Result 3}
\textit{In the CGE game, the median cutoff strategy is 70.}\\

While roughly 25\% of players select a low cutoff strategy,  similar to the one in the CGO game in Figure \ref{fig:allcutoff}, the majority of players select a cutoff value such that $\hat{x}_{_{CGE}}> \hat{x}_{_{CGO}}$ (p-value of .043 using subject data, see Table \ref{tab(cutoff-pvalue)}).\footnote{If we take an extremely conservative approach and work at the group level, then we do not find a statistically significant difference across treatments.}  There is also a sizable mass (35\%) of players who select a cutoff strategy with values above the predicted NE of 90. The overall distribution of cutoff strategies in the CGE game is quite similar to the one in the CGS game. We fail to reject the hypothesis that the two cutoff choices come from the same distribution (see Table \ref{tab(cutoff-pvalue)}). Therefore, we have evidence in favor of Hypothesis 3B instead of Hypothesis 3A.

\end{table}

To control for group effects we also perform panel regressions, presented in Table \ref{table:ols_cutoff}, which confirm our conclusions from the nonparametric analysis. We use all eleven periods, and cluster standard errors at the session level, and random effects at the subject level. We evaluate three alternative specifications of cutoff regressions on different regressors, including: $CGS$, which takes on the value of one when the treatment is a CGS game and zero otherwise; $CGE$, which takes on the value of one when the treatment is a CGE game and zero otherwise; a trend variable $Period$, which controls for learning throughout the session; an interaction between the trend and the treatments, $Period \times CGS$ or $Period \times CGE$; the gender variable $Men$, which takes on the value of one when the subject is a man and zero otherwise; and the interaction between gender and treatments, $Men \times CGS$ or $Men \times CGE$. We first focus on specifications (I) and (II) of Table \ref{table:ols_cutoff} and discuss the gender differences in the final section. 

The mean cutoff choice in the CGO treatment (specification I) is about 54 which is above the NE prediction of 33. We do not find statistical differences across treatments without controlling for learning, as in specifications (II), however the sign of the coefficient is consistent with the direction of the predictions. According to our predictions, the cutoff for CGS should be higher than in CGO. Indeed, we observe that the cutoff choice for players in the CGS treatment increases by about nine over time. The mean cutoff of CGE is similar to the one observed for CGS. Players in the CGO treatment, on the other hand, decrease their cutoff choices over time as suggested by the negative sign of the trend in specification (II). This is consistent with the NE predictions for CGS.\footnote{The variable $Period$ is analyzed at the mean of six, when it is statistically significant.} For CGE, we can conclude that there is some evidence that some players behave similarly to the players in a CGS game, though we elaborate on the type of encounters found in this treatment further below. The extremely low $R^2$ in the regressions is due to the high heterogeneity observed in the cutoff choices common in these games (e.g. see Duffy and Ochs, 2012).

Next, we analyze the joint distribution of outcomes in all treatments by counting the frequency of each outcome ($HH$, $HD$, $DH$ and $DD$) in each treatment. In Figure \ref{fig:cutpooled}, we assume that $HD\equiv DH$ but later we break down the outcome according to first and second movers in the CGS game and when the encounter is sequential in the CGE game. We focus mainly on the outcome $DD$ since we are interested in studying whether endogenous timing can reduce the frequency of $H$. In Figure \ref{fig:cutpooled}, we observe that for CGO, the $DD$ outcome is around 30\%, and the off-diagonal cells appear most often, at around 50\%. The outcomes for both the CGS and CGE treatments are quite different from the CGO outcomes. The sequential order of play helps achieve greater coordination with respect to $DD$ and $HH$ outcomes, which occur around 50\% and 40\% of the time, respectively. The CGE game presents a similar level of coordination with respect to the $DD$ outcomes relative to the CGS game.\\

\noindent \textbf{Result 4}
\textit{The $DD$ outcome appears more often in the CGS and CGE environments.}\\

We present a more detailed frequency analysis of each cell in Table \ref{tab(cells)}, as well as the predictions according to the NE. For the sequential move games (CGS and 52\% of encounters in CGE), we denote $DH$ when the first mover plays $D$ and the second mover responds with $H$. Our statistical analysis uses each of the six groups (of 12 subjects) as a single observation to conduct a Wilcoxon test. We find that $DD$ outcome is far from the NE prediction for both CGO (p-value of .031) and CGS treatments (p-value of .031). Furthermore, we reject the hypothesis that the frequency of $DD$ in the CGO environment is equal to the frequency in the CGS (p-value of .036) or CGE (p-value of .030) environments. Additionally, we fail to reject the hypothesis that frequency of $DD$ in CGS and CGE come from the same distribution. Therefore, we confirm our Hypothesis 4.\footnote{We omit panel regressions when analyzing the joint frequency given that the nonparametric tests are at the group level which strictly satisfies the independence assumption across observations. Using all periods does not change the conclusions of our tests. The data at the group level is presented in Appendix C, which also includes regression analysis of profits. Profit is higher in the CGE and CGS environments compared to the CGO game.}

\end{table}


The similar frequency of $DD$ in CGS and CGE games is due to a large fraction of encounters being sequential in the CGE treatment. In the CGE environment, it is difficult to coordinate timing, which is illustrated by a significant number of simultaneous encounters in the first period and the second period (13\% and 34\% respectively). The higher frequency of second period encounters suggests that subjects have a preference to move last, as it provides the flexibility to modify the cutoff choice when a counterparty moves first. Some important gender differences appear in the CGE game, which we study in greater detail below.\\


\noindent \textbf{Result 5}
\textit{Gender differences appear only in the CGE game. Men significantly increase their cutoff value, improving the frequency with which $D$ is selected, while women revert to a strategy similar to the one in the CGO game. The men who commit to $D$ move first more often than those who commit to $H$.}\\

The CGE game presents a similar level of coordination with respect to the $DD$ outcome as the CGS game. The mean cutoff by gender, however, is quite different. The cutoff strategy chosen by women in the CGE game is similar to their strategy in the CGO game. The men, on the other hand, increase their cutoff strategies, relative to the CGO game. Figure \ref{fig:cdfgender1} presents the CDF of the cutoff strategy by gender in the CGO game (left panel) and the CGS  game (right panel). We fail to reject that the cutoffs are equal across gender in both CGO and CGS treatments. Therefore, we partially confirm Hypothesis 5. Furthermore, in the CGS game, conditional on observing $D$ in the first period, we do not observe any gender differences in the responses of the second mover.

The cutoff strategy choices in the CGE game by men first order stochastically dominate the cutoff strategy choices by women, which we depict in the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:cdfgender2}. We reject the null hypothesis which states that men choose a cutoff strategy that is equal to the one chosen by women (p-value of .003). The higher cutoff choices by men lead to higher frequency of $D$ compared to women.\footnote{Using all periods, we also confirm the separation between cutoffs (p-value of .06). The difference of $D$ play across gender is significant at a 5\% significance level in the regression analysis, see Table \ref{table:ols_all} in Appendix C.} Table \ref{table:ols_cutoff} also presents gender differences using panel (OLS) regressions. According to specification (III), the variable $Men$ is only significant in the CGE treatment. Women use a cutoff similar to the one in the CGO treatment ($1.56\times 6-12.57= -3.21$) while men increase their cutoffs relative to women by 17 points in the CGE treatment.

\par\end{center}


Next, we analyze gender differences in the CGE game according to the order of play. We run a logit regression in Table \ref{table:move_cge} which includes individual random effects and clustered standard errors by group (12 subjects). The dependent variable is the timing of play (one when the player chooses to move second, and zero otherwise), while the independent variable \textit{D commitment}, in specification (I), is a binary variable that takes the value of one when the player commits to play $D$, and zero otherwise. Recall that the commitment is driven by the random realization of $x$ with respect to the cutoff choice. According to specification (I), the likelihood of choosing to move second is higher than choosing to move first. The commitment to play $D$ is not significant but the negative sign on the coefficient follows the predicted direction of the CGS equilibrium, which implies that a first mover has strong incentive to set the stage by choosing $D$. 

Specification (II) in Table \ref{table:move_cge} adds the gender variable. In the previous discussion of cutoffs in the CGE game, we showed that men are more willing to move their cutoffs as in the CGS game. Here, we show that men who commit to $D$ move first more frequently than those who commit to $H$, which is consistent with the CGS equilibrium. The (log) odds that a man who commits to $H$ will move second increases by 1.26, while a man who commits to $D$ is less likely to move second (a decrease in the log-odds of  $-0.72$). We do not find statistical differences in the odds for women. That is, they randomly select to move across  both periods. This behavior is consistent with the cutoff choice in a simultaneous game. A player who believes that the game is simultaneous is indifferent between the first and second period of play. The results are robust when we control for Period in specification (III) of Table \ref{table:move_cge}, which captures learning effects. 
%We find that men are 8.7 percentage points more likely (p-value of .04) to pick second period in the CGE compared to women. Women opted for the first period 50.8 percent of the time.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discuss}

In this paper, we provide experimental evidence on how strategic commitment can enhance social welfare in conflict scenarios. The experimental design includes (i) a simultaneous game, (ii) a sequential order of play, and (iii) an endogenous order of play. Furthermore, we seek to study whether gender differences are important to explain strategic behavior in conflict games of incomplete information. The results show that a sequential order of play improves welfare relative to the simultaneous game. Gender is not important in explaining behavior of either the sequential or the simultaneous game. When players are allowed to self-select the order of play, we find that women prefer to move first and adopt a cutoff similar to the one in the simultaneous-move game, while men adopt a cutoff similar to the one in the sequential game. We find that men who commit to $D$ are less likely to move second, which follows the predictions of the separating equilibrium. 


Our results provide important insights into a variety of games of incomplete information. First, the strategic interaction of players is similar across gender when the underlying game is of strategic complements and therefore, one should not be surprised if gender differences are not observed. This is consistent with previous literature which does not find strong evidence of gender differences in simultaneous move Prisoners Dilemma and Stag Hunt games. Second, there is a large heterogeneity in choices within each gender. Using a slider to implement cutoffs, we are able to observe the values which trigger Hawkish play. Third, risk attitudes across gender in endogenous move games are important in explaining behavior. Men prefer to wait and see what the first mover selects when they commit to $H$, but decide to move first when they commit to $D$. Women, on the other hand, prefer to guarantee a relatively safe payoff by selecting a lower cutoff, thus increasing the frequency of $H$ play.  

Although we began by describing the BS04 game as a sort of bank-run model, the game can be applied to other conflict scenarios such as negotiations of sanctions, or corporate disputes, where actions are characterized as strategic complements. For an overview of the experimental literature on conflict and contest games, please refer to Kimbrough et al., (2017). Future research can provide additional insights on the role of gender in other endogenous timing games. Our work suggests that different motivations can lead to similar outcomes in simultaneous games, but important differences may arise when players are allowed to pick different timing.

\section*{Appendix A}

\subsection*{Proof of Lemma 2.}

If the first mover $i$ plays $H$, then the second mover will play $\sigma_j= H$ if $x_j> k-d$ and $\sigma_j= D$ otherwise. Similarly, if the first mover plays $D$, then the second mover will play $\sigma_j= H$ if $\mu+x_j> k$ and  $\sigma_j= D$ otherwise. Given the best response strategy of the second mover, the first mover is indifferent between $H$ and $D$ when the payoffs of $H$ and $D$ are equal, or $x_i + \mu F(k-d) = k - d(1-F(k-\mu))$. Given that $F$ follows a uniform distribution with support $[0,k]$, we obtain that $x_i=\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}:= k-\mu=90$ $\blacksquare$

\subsection*{Proof of Proposition 1.}

We start with the analysis of a pooling equilibrium in which both players select the first period $t=1$ and adopt a threshold strategy $\hat{x}$. The (ex-ante) expected payoff is then
\begin{equation}
   \pi^{pool}_{i} = 
   \begin{cases}
    x_i + \mu \cdot F(\hat{x}), &  \text{if} \  x_{i}> \hat{x};\\
    k - d \cdot (1-F(\hat{x})), & \text{otherwise}. 
   \end{cases}
   \label{pi_pool}
\end{equation}

The cutoff strategy should then follow the solution in BS04, so that $\hat{x}=\hat{x}_{_{CG0}}$ as in the one shot game. A player who deviates and plays $t=2$ does not obtain higher ex-ante profit than $\pi^{pool}_{i}$  in equation (\ref{pi_pool}). Thus, the pooling equilibrium follows the CGO equilibrium as in BS04. 

We first examine if there exists any separating strategy equilibrium in the game with strategic complements. The candidate separating equilibrium follows the exogenous sequential game CGS in which the first mover plays $D$ if $x_i\leq \hat{x}_{_{CGS}}:= k-\mu$. Consider the following separating strategy for player $i $:
\begin{equation}
 t_i(x_i)=
 \begin{cases} 1; D, \mbox{ if } x_i  \leq \hat{x}_{_{CGS}}, \\
 2,  \text{otherwise}.
 \end{cases}
 \label{timing}
\end{equation}
Suppose that player $i$'s type is $x_i >\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}$, and that he/she chooses $t_i=2$ by following the timing strategy  in (\ref{timing}).  Since the probability that player $j$ chooses $t_j=2$ is $1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})$, the late simultaneous-move game will be played with probability $1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})$; and the sequential-move game in which player $i$ is the second mover will be played with probability $F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})$.

In the late simultaneous-move game, both players will update beliefs such that the prior type space $[0, k]$ is truncated to $[\hat{x}_{_{CGS}},k]$. In this case, the preplay timing choice completely eliminates the probability that the opponent chooses $D$, and there exists a unique BNE in which all types $x_i \in [\hat{x}_{_{CGS}},k]$ play $H$ with probability one.\footnote{See also BS04 for the formal proof.} 
 
If player $j$ plays $D$ early in the first period, then the second-mover player $i$ will play $D$ unless he/she is a dominant strategy hawk or $x_i>k-\mu$. Hence, player $i$'s ex-ante expected payoff from moving late in the second period is
\begin{equation}
\pi_i(t_i=2)=(1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}))\cdot x_i+F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}) \cdot k,
\end{equation}
for $x_i\leq k-\mu$; and
\begin{equation}
\pi_i(t_i=2)=(1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}))\cdot x_i+F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}) \cdot (x_i+\mu)=x_i + \mu\cdot  F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}),
\end{equation}for a dominant strategy hawk, (i.e., $x_i> k-\mu$). Note that this player is then indifferent between playing $H$ in the second period and the first period because it yields equal profit. Therefore, a dominant strategy hawk player $x_i>\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}$ does not obtain higher profit from deviating to the first period, 

\begin{equation}
\pi_i(t_i=1;H)=(1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}))\cdot(x_i)+F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})\cdot (x_i+\mu) = x_i+\mu\cdot F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}). \notag
\end{equation}

Next, suppose that player $i$'s type is $x_i \leq \hat{x}_{_{CGS}}$, and that he/she plays $D$ early by following the strategy (\ref{timing}), (i.e., $t_i(c_i)=1; D$). Then, the early simultaneous-move game will be played with probability $F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})$; and the sequential-move game in which player $i$ is the first mover will be played with probability $1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})$. Hence, player $i$'s ex-ante expected payoff from playing $D$ in the first period is
\begin{align}
\pi_i(t_i=1; D)&=(1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}))(k-d) +F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})\cdot k\\
&= k - (1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})) d.\notag
\end{align}
To prove that the separating strategy in (\ref{timing}) is an equilibrium, we need to check if a dovish player $i$ whose type is $x_i \leq \hat{x}_{_{CGS}}$ has an incentive to deviate to the second period. The ex-ante expected payoff from deviation to the second period is
\begin{equation}
\pi_i(t_i=2)=(1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})) \cdot (k-d) +F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}) \cdot k =k-d(1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})) \notag
\end{equation}
It is straightforward to see that there is no incentive for a dovish player whose type is $x_i \leq \hat{x}_{_{CGS}}$ to deviate to the second period.  Therefore, the separating strategy in (\ref{timing}) is an equilibrium strategy.

To complete the proof, we show that the following strategy timing is not an equilibrium, 
\begin{equation}
 t_i(x_i)=
 \begin{cases} 1; H, \mbox{ if } x_i  > \hat{x}_{_{CGS}}, \\
 2,  \text{otherwise}.
 \end{cases}
 \label{timing2}
\end{equation}
If both players decide to move early in the first period, it becomes the early simultaneous-move game in which both play $H$. If player $j$ chooses the second period, then the second-mover player $j$ will play $H$ with probability $F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})-F(k-d)$, and play $D$ with probability $F(k-d)$. Hence, player $i$'s ex-ante expected payoff from playing $H$ early in the first period is
\begin{align}
\pi_i(t_i=1; H)&=(1-F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}))\cdot x_i+F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}) [x_i+\mu\cdot F(k-d)]\\
&=x_i + \mu\cdot F(k-d)\notag \\
\end{align}
If that player deviates to the second period, then the expected payoff is 

\begin{equation}
\pi_i(t_i=2)= x + \mu\cdot F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}})\notag
\end{equation}which is larger than $\pi_i(t_i=1; H)$ given than $F(\hat{x}_{_{CGS}}\equiv k-\mu)>F(k-d)$. Thus, the timing strategy in  (\ref{timing2}) cannot be an equilibrium.

To check whether the game with strategic substitutes ($d<\mu$) has any separating equilibrium, consider the separating strategy in (\ref{timing}). Suppose that each player's type is $x_i \in (k-\mu, k]$ who chose $t_i(x_i)=2$. However, it cannot be an equilibrium because a dominant strategy hawk ($x_i > k-d$) will have an incentive to deviate to $t_i(x_i)=1; H$. Due to the same reason, the timing strategy in (\ref{timing2}) cannot be an equilibrium, either. Therefore, there is not any separating equilibrium when the game has strategic substitutes. $\blacksquare$




\section*{Appendix B}

\subsection*{Instructions CGE}

Welcome! This is a two player game. Each participant is paid COL 10 000 for attending, and depending on your choices, you will earn more cash.

Please turn off your devices, remain silent and do not look at other participants' screens. If you have any questions, or need assistance of any kind, please raise your hand and we will come to you. If you disrupt the experiment by talking, laughing, etc. you may be asked to leave without compensation. We expect and appreciate your cooperation today.

The experiment consists of 5 practice rounds and 11 paid rounds. In each round, you are randomly matched with another participant. You will not know the identity of the other participant. You will meet with each participant once and only once.
    
\noindent \textbf{Description of the game}

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
& Other participant action A & Other participant action B \\
\hline
Your action A & X points, NN points & X+10, 5 points  \\
\hline
Your action B & 5 points, NN+10 points & 100 points, 100 points
\end{tabular}
\caption{Payoffs}
\label{tablee}
\end{table}
In each round, you will get points according to the choices you and your counterparty made of A or B. The points are computed as follows, 

\begin{itemize}
\item If both chose A: you get X points and the other participant gets NN points. These points appear in the northwest cell of Table \ref{tablee}. 
\item  If you chose A and the other participant chose B:  you get X + 10 points and the other participant gets 5 points
\item  If you chose B and the other participant chose A: you get 5 points and the other participant gets NN + 10 points 
\item If both chose B: You and the other participant receive 100 points.

\end{itemize}

The random numbers X and NN (yours and the other participant, respectively) are generated by the software in a interval between 0 and 100. Each number has an equal probability of being drawn in every round. You have information about X but not about NN. 

The choice between A and B is made before you know the value of X. The way to play the game is as follows: You pick the lowest number (between 0 and 101) of X for which you will play A. This choice is made with the help of a slider. Table \ref{tableef} summarizes the relationship between the random number X and your choice. 

\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Play A & Your choice $\leq$ X \\
\hline
Play B & Your choice $>$  X  \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Your choice between A and B}
\label{tableef}
\end{table}

Recall that your choice of the lowest number for which you will play A is made before you know X. Once you and the other participant make a choice, then the software creates a random number for you and another for the other participant. The random number X is then used to define whether you will play A or B. 

The game proceeds in such way that you also choose the period you will play A or B. There are two periods: morning and night. If one picks morning and the other picks night, then the player that chose night can change or not the choice after observing what the morning player did. If both players pick the same period (morning or night) then the points are computed according to Table \ref{tablee}. 

In the case that one picks the morning and the other night, the night player will observe the decision made by the morning player. The screen will show a Table similar to Table \ref{tablee} but only depicting the choice made by the morning player. For example, if the morning player picks A, then the other player will observe only the first column. Now, the choice between A and B is made by clicking on the A or B options. Similarly, if the morning player picks B, then the other player will only observe the second column of Table \ref{tablee} and picks A and B by clicking on the options. According to these actions, the payoffs are computed. 

You should remember that in every round the random numbers are generated. That is, it is very likely that the value of X you observe varies every round, but always be between 0 and 100. 

\noindent \textbf{Practice rounds}

Before we start playing the game in which you will earn cash, you will practice through five periods so that you become familiar with the interface. The other participant in these practice rounds is a robot that strategically plays at the same time as you. In the practice rounds, you will not make a choice about the period you will play A or B. After the practice rounds, you will have the option to choose between the two periods as we described above. The points you earn in the practice rounds are not part of your earnings.


\noindent \textbf{Earnings}

At the end of each round, you will see your current points as well as information regarding your previous choices and points.  We will pay you in cash at the end of the experiment based on the points you earned over the total rounds. Your points will be converted to cash at the rate announced on the whiteboard, plus an additional COL 10 000 for participating today. 


\section*{ Appendix C}

The regressions in Table \ref{table:ols_all} include as dependent variable the profit (specifications I-II) and whether the player pick $D$ or $H$ (specifications III-IV). We denote as play $D$ which takes the value of one when the player choose $D$, and zero otherwise. We include different regressors: variable CGS which takes on the value of one for the CGS treatment and zero otherwise; CGE which takes on the value of one for the CGE treatment and zero otherwise; the trend variable $Period$ which controls for learning throughout the session; the interaction between the trend and the treatments $Period \times CGS$ or $Period \times CGE$; the gender variable $Men$ which takes on the value of one when the subject is a man and zero otherwise; and the interaction effect between gender and treatments $Men \times CGS$ or $Men \times CGE$. All specifications include random effects at the subject level and the standard errors are clustered at the group of level of 12 players.  

Table \ref{table:dd} presents the frequency of joint $DD$ choices in each of the six groups for all treatments.
